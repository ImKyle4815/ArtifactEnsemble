# ArtifactEnsemble
A Risk of Rain 2 Mod that focuses on adding various Artifacts that add an additional layer of configurability to the game.

## Artifacts:
- Artifact of Trade:
    Starts the run in the space bazaar, and spawns the blue portal every stage.
- Artifact of Fortune:
    Every time a blue portal spawns, each player's lunar coin count will be increased to 2-billion.
- Artifact of Reanimation:
    All dead players are revived at the beginning of each teleporter event.
- Artifact of Bazaar:
	Adds a Scrapper and Cleansing Pool to the space bazaar.
- Artifact of the Summit:
	Activates mountain shrines every teleporter event for each completed loop, plus 1.
- Artifact of Haste:
	Faster scrapping/printing.
- Artifact of Greed:
	Unlimited Scavenger-bag drops per stage.

## Other Features:
- No bazaar kickout:
    Damaging the trader will no longer kick you out of the bazaar.
- In-game artifact toggling:
    Adds a console command "ae_toggle ARTIFACTNAME" that will enable/disable artifacts.
